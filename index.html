		  		When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it! We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

				  If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon. I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.
